			<h4 id="save_energy">Save energy at home</h4>
            <h5>Much of our electricity and heat are powered by coal, oil, and gas. Use less energy by lowering your heating and cooling, switching to LED light bulbs and energy-efficient electric appliances, washing your laundry with cold water, or hanging things to dry instead of using a dryer.</h5>
            <h4 id="etc">Walk, cycle, or take public transport</h4>
			<h5>The world's roads are clogged with vehicles, most of them burning diesel or petrol. Walking or riding a bike instead of driving will reduce greenhouse gas emissions â€“ and help your health and fitness. For longer distances, consider taking a train or bus. And carpool whenever possible.</h5>
            <h4 id="eat">Eat more vegetables</h4>
			<h5>Eating more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, and less meat and dairy, can significantly lower your environmental impact. Producing plant-based foods generally results in fewer greenhouse gas emissions and requires less energy, land, and water.</h5>
